# Genomic data analysis


Taken the Cytochrome C gene of the dog (*Canis familiaris*), the aim is to write a program that analyses its Cytochrome C gene (downloaded from Ensembl) and the following outcomes of the analysis are made :

- Total length of gene.
- The number of exons and introns.
- Length of each exon and introns.
- The nucleic base A, T, G, C count for entire gene as well as for entire exon and intron region.
- CG-ratio of each intron and exon along with entire gene.


All this information is then outputted as a summary of the analyzed data in [Summary.txt] (LifeScience-Informatics-Assignment/Assignment1/Summary.txt)
